2.0.0 was released on https://github.com/bitfehler/xs3p/,
since the FiForms Solutions page hosting xs3p became
unavailable.

* Major re-design using the Bootstrap framework
* Support UTF-8 output

xs3p.xsl was modified to point to the new GitHub fork.

Credits to Martin Beran from Trusted Network Solutions
for submitting the patch.


=== 1.1.4

FiForms Solutions took up responsibility of hosting xs3p

while retaining the old link to DSTC.
